<title>MongoDB Asynchronous Java Driver - Connection Interfaces</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Provides interfaces for managing connections to different MongoDB server configurations.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Users should not need to directly use the classes within this package.
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p> 
{@link com.allanbank.mongodb.connection.ConnectionFactory} instances are responsible for creating and
managing the state for a set of connections to MongoDB.  {@link com.allanbank.mongodb.connection.Connection}
provides the basic interface for sending and asynchronously receiving replies from the MongoDB servers.
Connection factories and connections are layered to achieve the desired interaction with the MongoDB servers.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="bootstrap/package-summary.html">com.allanbank.mongodb.connection.bootstrap</p> package
contains a <tt>ConnectionFactory</tt> that simply detects the type of MongoDB cluster being used and 
then delegates all future request to an appropriate delegate for the cluster type.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="auth/package-summary.html">com.allanbank.mongodb.connection.auth</p> package
contains a <tt>ConnectionFactory</tt> that wraps another connection factory and ensures 
all requests are properly authenticated prior to being sent to the server.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="rs/package-summary.html">com.allanbank.mongodb.connection.rs</p> package
that knows how to manage connections to a replica-set configuration.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="sharded/package-summary.html">com.allanbank.mongodb.connection.sharded</p> package
that knows how to manage connections to a sharded configuration.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="socket/package-summary.html">com.allanbank.mongodb.connection.socket</p> package
that creates a direct socket connection to the MongoDB server.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="proxy/package-summary.html">com.allanbank.mongodb.connection.proxy</p> package
contains base classes for <tt>ConnectionFactory</tt> and <tt>Connection</tt> implementations
that delegate to another implementation.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="state/package.html">com.allanbank.mongodb.connection.state</a> package contains 
support classes for state management.
