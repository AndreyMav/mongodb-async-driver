<title>MongoDB Asynchronous Java Driver</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
The default MongoDB Java driver blocks the calling thread during the entire round trip 
from the client to the MongoDB server and back.  This induces a latency of several to 10's of milliseconds
per request.  For high transaction applications this latency is difficult to eliminate.  The easiest solution 
to mitigate this overhead is to utilize multiple threads on the client and outbound connections to the servers.
Each connection ties up resources on the MongoDB servers that could be utilized for caching data, etc.
</p>
<p>
The MongoDB Asynchronous Java Driver operates at the core completely asynchronously using a message passing 
model between the client threads and dedicated I/O threads.  To ensure thread safety for the objects passed 
between the threads almost all BSON and other domain objects are immutable.
<p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Most users will interact with the driver via the three primary interfaces: {@link com.allanbank.mongodb.Mongo}, 
{@link com.allanbank.mongodb.MongoDatabase} and {@link com.allanbank.mongodb.MongoCollection}.  Interfaces 
are provided to allow easier mocking in client tests.  The implementation of the <tt>Mongo</tt> interface obtained
via the {@link com.allanbank.mongodb.MongoFactory}.
</p>
<p>
A strongly typed, immutable BSON library is provided via the 
<a href="bson/package-summary.html">com.allanbank.mongodb.bson</a> package.  It provides the building blocks
for BSON documents sent to and retrieved from MongoDB.
