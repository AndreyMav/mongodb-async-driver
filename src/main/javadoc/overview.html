<title>MongoDB Asynchronous Java Driver</title>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Why expend the effort to create a new driver?  Why not use the effort to improve the 10gen 
supported (legacy) Java driver? Those are very good questions.  To get to the answer we have 
to look at the very core of the legacy driver's processing model.  
</p>
<p>
The legacy driver maintains a set of open connections and when a processing thread sends a 
request the following actions are performed:
<ol>
<li>Checks a connection out of the pool of open connections.</li>
<li>Writes the request to the connection.</li>
<li>Reads the response from the connection.</li>
<li>Returns the connection to the pool of open connections.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
This synchronous checkout/request/response/checkin means that each request must wait for the complete  
round trip time for the request, processing and response.  For many applications the
latency induced can be simply overcome by using more connections.  For either highly distributed
or high performance applications the connection explosion that occurs induces performance and 
scheduler issues on the MongoDB servers that limits the utility of this approach.
</p>
<p>
Rather than try to force a more asynchronous model on the 10gen driver the MongoDB Asynchronous 
Java Driver instead creates a completely new driver that at its very core is asynchronous.  The
interface to the driver still provides synchronous methods but they are implemented using the 
asynchronous variants of the methods.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Most users will interact with the driver via the three primary interfaces: {@link com.allanbank.mongodb.Mongo}, 
{@link com.allanbank.mongodb.MongoDatabase} and {@link com.allanbank.mongodb.MongoCollection}.  Interfaces 
are provided to allow easier mocking in client tests.  The implementation of the <tt>Mongo</tt> interface is created
via the {@link com.allanbank.mongodb.MongoFactory}. 
</p>
<p>
A strongly typed, immutable BSON library is provided via the 
<a href="bson/package-summary.html">com.allanbank.mongodb.bson</a> package.  It provides the building blocks
for BSON documents sent to and retrieved from MongoDB.
